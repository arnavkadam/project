        <h2>What is Cricket?</h2>
        <article>
            <p> Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport that originated in England and is now popular in many countries
                around the world, particularly in countries like India, Australia, England, and Pakistan. In cricket,
                two teams, each consisting of 11 players, take turns batting and fielding. The batting team tries to
                score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the fielding team tries
                to dismiss the batsmen and limit the number of runs scored.
            </p>
            <p>Cricket is played on an oval-shaped field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center. The game
                has different formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches,
                each with its own rules and duration. Cricket is known for its rich traditions, complex rules, and
                strategies, and it often spans several hours or even days, making it a unique and deeply ingrained
                part of the sporting culture in many countries.

        <h2>Cricket Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cricket Ball:</strong> The cricket ball is typically made of cork and covered with leather. It
                is hard and durable, designed for fast bowling and spin. There are different types of cricket balls used
                in various formats of the game, with red balls commonly used in Test matches and white balls in
                limited-overs formats like ODIs and T20s.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cricket Bat:</strong> The cricket bat is made of wood, traditionally from willow, and consists
                of a blade and a handle. Bats come in various sizes and shapes to suit a player's preference. The blade
                is used for striking the ball, while the handle provides grip and control.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Stumps and Bails:</strong> Stumps are three vertical wooden posts that are placed at each end of
                the pitch. Bails are small wooden pieces that rest on top of the stumps. The stumps and bails are used
                to define the wickets and are crucial for run-outs and dismissals.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cricket Pads:</strong> Also known as leg guards, cricket pads are worn by batsmen to protect
                their legs from the impact of the ball. They consist of padded guards that wrap around the legs,
                covering the shins and knees.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cricket Helmet:</strong> A cricket helmet is worn by batsmen and wicket-keepers to protect their
                head from fast deliveries and bouncers. It includes a grill or visor to shield the face.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Batting Gloves:</strong> Batting gloves are worn by batsmen to protect their hands and provide a
                better grip on the bat. They are padded and offer protection to the fingers, palms, and knuckles.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Wicket-keeping Gloves:</strong> Wicket-keeping gloves are designed for the wicket-keeper and
                have additional padding on the fingers to help with catching the ball.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Thigh Guard and Chest Guard:</strong> Batsmen may also wear additional protective equipment like
                thigh guards and chest guards to safeguard vulnerable areas of their body from impact.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cricket Shoes:</strong> Cricket shoes have specialized spikes (usually rubber or metal) on the
                sole to provide traction on the pitch. Proper footwear is essential for both batsmen and bowlers to
                maintain balance and prevent injury.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cricket Clothing:</strong> Players typically wear white or colored cricket jerseys and trousers.
                The clothing is designed to be comfortable and moisture-wicking. In limited-overs formats, players often
                wear colored clothing.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Umpire's Equipment:</strong> Umpires also have their equipment, which includes a hat or cap, a
                set of light meters to measure the brightness of the light, and protective gear, including a chest guard
                and shin guards.</li>
        </ul>
